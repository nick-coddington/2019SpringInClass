## Background in Computer Science
---
I am relatively new when it comes to computers. Of course, I grew up with them and have been using them since I was younger in middle school and more into high school. But when it came to how they work or creating more with them; this is where I am trying to gain traction. So far, I have taken a couple courses. The first course was Programming and Data Structures, then came Computer Systems, and finally the Database course as well. My background is in business/finance. I got my bachelorâ€™s degree here then decided to come back. I have tried to self-teach myself, however that was just before deciding to go back to school for computer science.

## What I hope to do in the future
---
Looking more towards my future. I have a couple things in mind. Knowing the job market and how robust it is for web programmers. I want to become more proficient in it. I also am interested in IT and cybersecurity work as well. So, ideally maybe something in the government would be in the cards for me. I enjoy what I have learned so far, and I am excited to see where this road takes me.
